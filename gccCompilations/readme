Most likely you will need to download 
XPACKS and install the riscv-none-gcc compiler.

You will first need to install node 
sudo apt install nodejs npm

make sure npm is installed correctly with 
npm --version

then install xpack
npm install --location=global xpm@latest

You can find guide on how to initialize the gcc here: https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/docs/install/

basically you will need to intialize the project as an xpack and then download the gcc

xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc@latest --verbose

ls -l xpacks/.bin

then you will need to export the path of the xpacks that you installed 
something along these lines

export PATH=~/Documents/rv32/xpacks/.bin:$PATH
